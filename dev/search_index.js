Default is save_everystep && !isempty(saveat) for algorithms which have the ability to produce dense output, i.e. by default it's true unless the user has turned off saving on steps or has chosen a saveat value. If dense=false, the solution still acts like a function, and sol(t) is a linear interpolation between the saved time points.\nsaveat: Denotes specific times to save the solution at, during the solving phase. The solver will save at each of the timepoints in this array in the most efficient manner available to the solver. If only saveat is given, then the arguments save_everystep and dense are false by default. If saveat is given a number, then it will automatically expand to tspan[1]:saveat:tspan[2]. For methods where interpolation is not possible, saveat may be equivalent to tstops. The default value is [].\nsave_idxs: Denotes the indices for the components of the equation to save. Defaults to saving all indices. For example, if you are solving a 3-dimensional ODE, and given save_idxs = [1, 3], only the first and third components of the solution will be outputted. Notice that of course in this case the outputed solution will be two-dimensional.\ntstops: Denotes extra times that the timestepping algorithm must step to. This should be used to help the solver deal with discontinuities and singularities, since stepping exactly at the time of the discontinuity will improve accuracy. If a method cannot change timesteps (fixed timestep multistep methods), then tstops will use an interpolation, matching the behavior of saveat. If a method cannot change timesteps and also cannot interpolate, then tstops must be a multiple of dt or else an error will be thrown. Default is [].\nd_discontinuities: Denotes locations of discontinuities in low order derivatives. This will force FSAL algorithms which assume derivative continuity to re-evaluate the derivatives at the point of discontinuity. The default is [].\nsave_everystep: Saves the result at every step. Default is true if isempty(saveat).\nsave_on: Denotes whether intermediate solutions are saved. This overrides the settings of dense, saveat and save_everystep and is used by some applicatioins to manually turn off saving temporarily. Everyday use of the solvers should leave this unchanged.
